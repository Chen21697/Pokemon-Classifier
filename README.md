# ML Classification Practice

<p>This project is a practice based on professor Hung-Yi Lee's ML Lecture. Notice that it is a binary classification case.
<br>
<br>The model looks like this:

<br>Generative Model is used in this project, which  assumes the training set is based on a Gaussian Distribution. After we find this optimal Gaussian Distribution, we can then use its parameters (mean and corvariance) to estimate the probability of input x being which class by using Bayes' theorem.
